# Bank Properties 
- We have worked closely with our domain experts and at one point we spotted a problem together with the exchange rates

| From | To   | Rate    |
|------|------|---------|
| EUR  | USD  | 1.2     |
| USD  | EUR  | 0.82    |
| USD  | KRW  | 1100    |
| KRW  | EUR  | 0.0009  |
| EUR  | KRW  | 1344    |
| KRW  | EUR  | 0.00073 |

- We have 2 times a line for `KRW` to `EUR`
- We discussed with our experts, and they explain to us that they have `simply` written the wrong destination currency (To) on line 4
    - Apparently, it can often happens...
    - The table now looks like this:

| From | To  | Rate    |
|------|-----|---------|
| EUR  | USD | 1.2     |
| USD  | EUR | 0.82    |
| USD  | KRW | 1100    |
| KRW  | USD | 0.0009  |
| EUR  | KRW | 1344    |
| KRW  | EUR | 0.00073 |

- We are not fully confident in this table that will be at the center of our system
    - We discuss again with our experts on a way to enforce this table coherence/consistency
    - The conclusion is that we can easily improve it by checking what they call `Round-Tripping`
    - `from(to(x)) == x`

```gherkin
Given an original amount in currency A
When we convert it to currency B and convert it back to currency A
Then we should receive the original amount 
```

## Property-Based Testing
We will use `Property-Based Testing` to implement `Round-Tripping` properties in a first step. 
It could help us better understand the business and discover edge cases.

In `scala` we can use [`scalacheck`](https://scalacheck.org/) to do so:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.scalatestplus" %% "scalacheck-1-15" % "3.2.11.0" % "test"
``` 

### Round-Tripping in same currency
We want to create a first property like this:

```text
for all (Money money)
such that (bank.convert(money, money.currency()) equals money)) is satisfied
```

:red_circle: Let's create a new test class to host the properties: `BankProperties`

```scala
class BankProperties extends AnyFunSuite with Checkers {
  private val exchangeRates: Map[(Currency, Currency), Double] = Map(
    (EUR, USD) -> 1.2,
    (USD, EUR) -> 0.82,
    (USD, KRW) -> 1100d,
    (KRW, USD) -> 0.0009,
    (EUR, KRW) -> 1344d,
    (KRW, EUR) -> 0.00073
  )

  test("convert in same currency should return original Money") {
    ???
  }
}
```

We want our property to look like this:

```scala
  private val bank: Bank = ???

  test("convert in same currency should return original Money") {
    forAll { (originalAmount: Double, currency: Currency) =>
      {
        val originalMoney = Money(originalAmount, currency)
        val convertedMoney = bank.convert(originalMoney, currency)

        convertedMoney.value == originalMoney
      }
    }.check()
  }
```

To do so we need to instantiate a `Bank` with business exchange rates, let's do it

```scala
  private val bank: Bank = createBank()

  private def newBank(): Bank = {
    val firstEntry = exchangeRates.head
    Bank.withExchangeRate(firstEntry._1._1, firstEntry._1._2, firstEntry._2)
  }

  private def createBank(): Bank =
    exchangeRates
      .drop(1)
      .foldLeft(newBank()) {
        case (bank, ((from, to), rate)) => bank.addExchangeRate(from, to, rate)
      }
```

:green_circle: We have to provide an `Arbitrary` for `Currency` as well

![Arbitrary for Currency](img/pbt-missing-currency-arbitrary.png)

```scala
  implicit def currencyGenerator: Arbitrary[Currency] =
    Arbitrary {
      Gen.oneOf(Currency.values.toSeq)
    }
```

:large_blue_circle: Let's refactor our class to make it more readable
- We can put "details" inside a `companion object`
- So we can directly empathize the `properties` when opening the class whithout any noise

```scala
import domain.BankProperties.{bank, currencyGenerator}
import domain.Currency._
import org.scalacheck.Prop.forAll
import org.scalacheck.{Arbitrary, Gen}
import org.scalatest.EitherValues
import org.scalatest.funsuite.AnyFunSuite
import org.scalatestplus.scalacheck.Checkers

class BankProperties extends AnyFunSuite with Checkers with EitherValues {
  test("convert in same currency should return original Money") {
    forAll { (originalAmount: Double, currency: Currency) =>
      {
        val originalMoney = Money(originalAmount, currency)
        bank.convert(originalMoney, currency).value == originalMoney
      }
    }.check()
  }
}

object BankProperties {
  private val exchangeRates: Map[(Currency, Currency), Double] = Map(
    (EUR, USD) -> 1.2,
    (USD, EUR) -> 0.82,
    (USD, KRW) -> 1100d,
    (KRW, USD) -> 0.0009,
    (EUR, KRW) -> 1344d,
    (KRW, EUR) -> 0.00073
  )

  private val bank: Bank = createBank()

  private def newBank(): Bank = {
    val firstEntry = exchangeRates.head
    Bank.withExchangeRate(firstEntry._1._1, firstEntry._1._2, firstEntry._2)
  }

  private def createBank(): Bank =
    exchangeRates
      .drop(1)
      .foldLeft(newBank()) {
        case (bank, ((from, to), rate)) => bank.addExchangeRate(from, to, rate)
      }

  implicit def currencyGenerator: Arbitrary[Currency] =
    Arbitrary {
      Gen.oneOf(Currency.values.toSeq)
    }
}
```

Congratulations on this first `Property` ðŸ‘Œ

### Round-Tripping in random currency
Let's go a little further by implementing it on random currency couples

```text
for all (double amount, Currency from, Currency to)
such that (bank.convert(bank.convert(money, to), from) equals money)) is satisfied
```
 
```scala
  test("round tripping in different currencies") {
    forAll { (originalAmount: Double, from: Currency, to: Currency) =>
      {
        val originalMoney = Money(originalAmount, from)

        bank
          .convert(originalMoney, to)
          .flatMap(convertedMoney => bank.convert(convertedMoney, from))
          .value == originalMoney
      }
    }.check()
  }
```

When we run it we have a surprise:

:red_circle: Round-Tripping as expressed by our domain experts is not working as expected with the provided values...
![Failing Round-tripping](img/pbt-first-failure.png)

Our `Property` has been easily falsified.

One good practice of `PBT` is to investigate failure by writing a classic Unit Test/Example-Based Test

> Never re-run on failures
 
:large_blue_circle: We refactor our `Property` code to be able to reuse the `Round-Tripping` logic.

```scala
test("round tripping in different currencies") {
    forAll { (originalAmount: Double, from: Currency, to: Currency) =>
      {
        roundTripConvert(originalAmount, from, to).value == Money(
          originalAmount,
          from
        )
      }
    }.check()
  }

  private def roundTripConvert(
      originalAmount: Double,
      from: Currency,
      to: Currency
  ): Either[String, Money] = {
    bank
      .convert(Money(originalAmount, from), to)
      .flatMap(convertedMoney => bank.convert(convertedMoney, from))
  }
```

We can now describe the example found by `scalacheck`
```scala
  test("round trip in error") {
    val originalAmount = -2.1645893211081448e69
    val roundTripMoney = roundTripConvert(originalAmount, EUR, USD)

    assert(roundTripMoney.value == Money(originalAmount, EUR))
  }
```

:red_circle: As expected we have an assertion error

![Example based error](img/pbt-example-failure.png)

Let's iterate on it with our domain experts
- Because of the lack of accuracy of the exchange rates we need to tolerate some loss
  - > For them, it is OK to have 0.01 loss for a round-tripping

:green_circle: We change the way we assert the `Round-Tripping` by integrating this knowledge
Our example test is now passing to green.

```scala
 @Property
public void roundTrippingInDifferentCurrencies(double originalAmount, Currency from, Currency to) {
    assertThat(roundTripConvert(originalAmount, from, to))
            .hasRightValueSatisfying(money ->
                    assertThatAmountAreClosed(originalAmount, money)
            );
}

@Test
public void roundTripInError() {
    var originalAmount = 9.051E-11;
    assertThat(roundTripConvert(originalAmount, EUR, USD))
            .hasRightValueSatisfying(money -> assertThatAmountAreClosed(originalAmount, money));
}

private void assertThatAmountAreClosed(Money originalMoney, Money roundTripMoney) {
    Assertions.assertThat(
            Math.abs(roundTripMoney.amount() - originalMoney.amount()) < toleranceFor(originalMoney)
    ).isTrue();
}

private Either<String, Money> roundTripConvert(double originalAmount, Currency from, Currency to) {
    return bank.convert(new Money(originalAmount, from), to)
            .flatMap(convertedMoney -> bank.convert(convertedMoney, from));
}
```

:red_circle: Even after the integration of this tolerance, the `Property` is still falsified.
We can not tolerate more loss...

![Property is still falsified](img/pbt-still-falsified.png)

> After a discussion, our domain experts recognize that exchange rates are not enough accurate and up-to-date...

They provide us an updated table for our tests:

| From | To  | Rate           |
|------|-----|----------------|
| EUR  | USD | 1.0567         |
| USD  | EUR | 0.9466         |
| USD  | KRW | 1302.0811      |
| KRW  | USD | 0.00076801737  |
| EUR  | KRW | 1368.51779     |
| KRW  | EUR | 0.00073        |

```scala
private final Map<Tuple2<Currency, Currency>, Double> exchangeRates =
        of(
                Tuple.of(EUR, USD), 1.0567,
                Tuple.of(USD, EUR), 0.9466,
                Tuple.of(USD, KRW), 1302.0811,
                Tuple.of(KRW, USD), 0.00076801737,
                Tuple.of(EUR, KRW), 1368.51779,
                Tuple.of(KRW, EUR), 0.00073
        );
```

:green_circle: With those new exchange rates the `Property` can not be falsified

:large_blue_circle: What can be improved?

In our 2 properties, we use a random `double` but it would be better to handle `Money` directly

```scala
@Property
public void convertInSameCurrencyShouldReturnOriginalMoney(double originalAmount, Currency currency) {
    var originalMoney = new Money(originalAmount, currency);

    assertThat(bank.convert(originalMoney, currency))
            .containsOnRight(originalMoney);
}

@Property
public void roundTrippingInDifferentCurrencies(double originalAmount, Currency from, Currency to) {
    assertThat(roundTripConvert(originalAmount, from, to))
            .hasRightValueSatisfying(money ->
                    assertThatAmountAreClosed(originalAmount, money)
            );
}
```

:large_blue_circle: We would like to have our properties expressed like this:
```scala
@Property
public void convertInSameCurrencyShouldReturnOriginalMoney(Money originalMoney) {
    assertThat(bank.convert(originalMoney, originalMoney.currency()))
                    .containsOnRight(originalMoney);
}
```

:red_circle: If we run it, an `Exception` is thrown.
We need to define how `junit-quickcheck` can generate our `Money` objects.
 
![Missing Money Generator](img/pbt-missing-money-generator.png)

We can create custom generators for our complex types (more info [here](https://pholser.github.io/junit-quickcheck/site/1.0/usage/other-types.html))

By writing this generator we wondered what are the boundaries of our `Money`: minimum and maximum amount. 
> According to our domain experts, our system should handle positive and negative numbers to a limit of 1 Billion no matter the currency. 

```scala
public class MoneyGenerator extends Generator<Money> {
    public static final int MAX_AMOUNT = 1_000_000_000;

    public MoneyGenerator() {
        super(Money.class);
    }

    @Override
    public Money generate(SourceOfRandomness sourceOfRandomness, GenerationStatus generationStatus) {
        return new Money(
                sourceOfRandomness.nextDouble(-MAX_AMOUNT, MAX_AMOUNT),
                sourceOfRandomness.choose(Currency.values())
        );
    }
}
```

:green_circle: To use it, we need to specify which generator to use in our `Property` by using the `@From`annotation.

```scala
@Property
public void convertInSameCurrencyShouldReturnOriginalMoney(@From(MoneyGenerator.class) Money originalMoney) {
    assertThat(bank.convert(originalMoney, originalMoney.currency()))
            .containsOnRight(originalMoney);
}
```

:large_blue_circle: Let's refactor our other `Property` to use this generator as well
```scala
@Property
public void roundTrippingInDifferentCurrencies(@From(MoneyGenerator.class) Money originalMoney,
                                               Currency to) {
    assertThat(roundTripConvert(originalMoney, to))
            .hasRightValueSatisfying(roundTripMoney ->
                    assertThatAmountAreClosed(originalMoney, roundTripMoney)
            );
}

private Either<String, Money> roundTripConvert(Money originalMoney, Currency to) {
    return bank.convert(originalMoney, to)
            .flatMap(convertedMoney -> bank.convert(convertedMoney, originalMoney.currency()));
}

private void assertThatAmountAreClosed(Money originalMoney, Money roundTripMoney) {
    Assertions.assertThat(
            Math.abs(roundTripMoney.amount() - originalMoney.amount()) < toleranceFor(originalMoney)
    ).isTrue();
}
```

![Property falsified wrong Offset](img/pbt-failure-offset.png)

:red_circle: It appears that we still have an issue with our `Property`. Generating random values by our own from -MAX_AMOUNT to MAX_AMOUNT seemed to have an effect on shrinking.
We discuss again with our domain experts and have a better understanding about what they meant regarding loss:
```text
for all (Money originalMoney, Currency to)
such that (bank.convert(bank.convert(originalMoney, to), from) equals money with a tolerance of 0.1% of the originalMoney)) is satisfied
```

Let's implement the tolerance as described above:
```scala
private double toleranceFor(Money originalMoney) {
    return Math.abs(0.001 * originalMoney.amount());
}
```

:green_circle: Our properties are now all green

```scala
@RunWith(JUnitQuickcheck.class)
public class BankProperties {
    private final Bank bank;

    private final Map<Tuple2<Currency, Currency>, Double> exchangeRates =

    }
}
```

## Reflect
During this iteration with `Property-Based Testing`, we asked ourselves a lot of questions regarding the Domain.
We have discovered a lot of rules that should be implemented in our Domain:
- Amount accepted for a Money representation
    - We now have a definition of what is a Valid Amount
- Round-Tripping should be checked when adding a currency inside the `Bank`
  - We have a clear description of the tolerance to apply

> Let's do it in the next iteration : add invariants to our domain
 
![Congratulations](img/pbt-demystified.png)


WIP

Next PBT in scala
- Loss authorized
	- Not good for the example found
- Rework on exchange rates
- Better but still not good
- 0.01% of tolerance should work
- What are the good amount
