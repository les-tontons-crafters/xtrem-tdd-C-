- Install Cucumber plugin available [here](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7212-cucumber-for-java)
- Create `scenario`

```gherkin
Feature: Portfolio evaluation
  Client can evaluate his/her Portfolio in the 3 currencies supported by our system.

  Background:
    Given our Bank system with EUR as Pivot Currency
    And exchange rate of 1.2 defined for USD
    And exchange rate of 1344 defined for KRW

  Scenario: Evaluate in EUR
    Given an existing customer
    And they add 5678.89 USD on their portfolio
    And they add 5674567.245 KRW on their portfolio
    And they add 9432 USD on their portfolio
    And they add 4989.67 EUR on their portfolio
    When they evaluate their portfolio in EUR the amount should be closed to 21804.227
```

- Generate steps for `Background` and the `Scenario`
  - At unit test level
  - Let's create an acceptance test

```java
public class PortfolioEvaluationStepDefinitions {
    private Bank bank;
    private Portfolio portfolio;

    @Given("our Bank system with {word} as Pivot Currency")
    public void bankWithPivot(String currency) {
        bank = Bank.withPivotCurrency(parseCurrency(currency));
    }

    private Currency parseCurrency(String currency) {
        return of(Currency.values())
                .find(c -> c.toString().equals(currency))
                .get();
    }

    @And("exchange rate of {double} defined for {word}")
    public void addExchangeRate(double rate, String currency) {
        bank = bank.add(rateFor(rate, parseCurrency(currency))).get();
    }

    @Given("an existing customer")
    public void anExistingCustomer() {
        portfolio = new Portfolio();
    }

    @And("they add {double} {word} on their portfolio")
    public void addInPortfolio(double amount, String currency) {
        portfolio = portfolio.add(new Money(amount, parseCurrency(currency)));
    }

    @When("they evaluate their portfolio in {word} the amount should be closed to {double}")
    public void evaluate(String currency, double expectedAmount) {
        var parsedCurrency = parseCurrency(currency);
        var expectedMoney = new Money(expectedAmount, parsedCurrency);

        assertThat(portfolio.evaluate(bank, parsedCurrency))
                .hasRightValueSatisfying(received -> assertClosedTo(received, expectedMoney));
    }

    private static void assertClosedTo(Money money, Money other) {
        Assertions.assertThat(money.currency()).isEqualTo(other.currency());
        Assertions.assertThat(money.amount()).isCloseTo(other.amount(), offset(0.001d));
    }
}
```
